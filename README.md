# puttyCluster

Fork of https://github.com/mingbowan/puttyCluster which is described there as:
* puttyCluster putty cluster / multi-session / multi-window input
* Simple AutoHotkey script to enable sending input to multiple putty window simultaneously.

For me personally this makes the script even more useful with a few simple extensions. It was already good.

### Features

* Multiple title match windows with enable checkboxes so you can have sets of putty sessions open.  These can be OR'd
* Preset seach pattern in the first title match checkbox to "all putty windows"
* Multiple preset screen sizes with a selector for quick switching between them for when you have few windows/lots of windows
* Add CrLf to "paste clipboard" so you can keep one liners in a text file for example
* ToBack and To Front buttons to quickly bring the matched windows to the front on the Desktop
* Laucher side panel for apps, Putty sessions and Putty commands.  
* INI file for configuration if you want to compile to exe
* Global shortcuts to bring to top and toggle side panel.  There is also a StayOnTop flag if you prefer
* Mulitple monitor supprt for Tile/Cascade functions

### install

First checkout the repository, then checkout this branch.  This example uses ssh to clone.  I notice that if you checkout using https, the commands are different.  This works but you have to sort out your ssh keys first (generate them locally and then add them to GitHUB).  Note that the master branch is current unmodified from the upstream repo.
```
git clone git://github.com/SpiroCx/puttyCluster.git
cd puttyCluster\
```

In addition to original useage (https://github.com/mingbowan/puttyCluster):

* Multiple regex's can be applied so windows can be kept in groups
* Regex's can be inverted.  !match
* Screen size for  Tile/Cascade can be quick switched with selector
* Paste Clipboard adds cr(lf)
* The Found Windows Filters let you further filter windows based on their screen position (after the title matches are applied).  This is useful if, say, you have putty windows arranged in groups per device (eg 3 on your Linux server, and 3 on your embedded device) and you temporarily only want one window from each of these groups to respond.  Lets say for example you switch from a command for all windows (ls, pwd, tail log.txt), to a command you only want to run once on each box (apt update, apt install).  That's when you use the Found Windows filter.  There are 3 options.  "All" just goes ahead and selects all windows as determined by the 5 title matching boxes, "1-8 on/off toggle" lets you pick up to the first 8 windows individually, and the text box (init value FFFF) lets you use a bitfield to specify the box positions.  Lets say you wanted boxes 2, 4, 7 and 8, the you put CA in this text box. 
* Global shortcut Win-Alt-C brings ClusterPutty window to the foreground
* Global shortcut Win-Alt-D brings ClusterPutty window to the foreground and toggles the launcher sidebar
* App shortcuts Alt-C (Paste Clipboard), Alt-L (toggle "add +CrLF" to clipboard paste), Alt-T (Tile), Alt+B/F (To Back/Front)

#### A good Putty window title greatly assists in window filtering

This script regex searches all the text in the Putty window titles.  Adding more info to your Putty window title gives you more power for filtering the windows out.  There are some crazy complicated prompts out there eg https://www.askapache.com/linux/bash-power-prompt/.  This relatively modest prompt puts the hostname and current path into the Putty window title.  
on the command line:
```
PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]\[\e[33m\]\u@\h:\[\e[m\]\[\e[31m\]\w\[\e[31m\]\[\e[36m\]$\[\e[m\] "
```
You can also add a custom tag in between the \w and \a which lets you put arbitrary text in the title.  This allows you to group Putty windows arbitrarily with puttyCluster.  On a session running a full bash, you can add a script to poke in a title tag like this:
in .bashrc or .profile:
```
getputtytag(){
   echo $puttytag
}
PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\$(getputtytag)\a\]\[\e[33m\]\u@\h:\[\e[m\]\[\e[31m\]\w\[\e[31m\]\[\e[36m\]$\[\e[m\] "
```
which allows you to set the Title tag with:
on the command line:
```
export puttytag=[AAA]
```
Smaller embeded platforms tend use busybox instead of a full shell.  If you are working with busybox, the script won't work (at least it doesn't on any of mine) but you can include a tag in the title directly in the PS1 command:
on the command line:
```
PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w[AAA]\a\]\[\e[33m\]\u@\h:\[\e[m\]\[\e[31m\]\w\[\e[31m\]\[\e[36m\]$\[\e[m\] "
```
I am using this one at the moment which includes git info, an ip address in the title, and a tag in the prompt to remind myself which puttyCluster group the putty session is part of:
in .bashrc or .profile:
```
getip120(){
   ifconfig | grep 120 | sed -n '1s/[^:]*:\([^ ]*\).*/\1/p'
}
getip235(){
   ifconfig | grep 235 | sed -n '1s/[^:]*:\([^ ]*\).*/\1/p'
}
getputtytitle(){
   echo $puttytitle
}
getputtyprompt(){
   echo $puttyprompt
}
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
PS1="\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\$(getputtytitle)\a\]\[\e[33m\]\u@\h:\[\e[m\]\[\e[36m\]\w\[\e[31m\]$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[36m\]\$(getputtyprompt)$\[\e[m\] "
```
Note in the above example the 120 and 235 are specific to my lan segments.  I can then set putty terminal with:
```
puttyprompt=[A]; puttytitle=[A][$(getip120)]
```

### Known issues
* The inverted regex is based on this expression: ^((?!MATCH).)*$ where MATCH is regex edit box term.  Using multiple enabled regex searches with negatives results in this sort of expression (^((?!MATCH1).)*$)|(^((?!MATCH2).)*$), the results of which get confusing.  I usually use it the invert to tag a group of putty windows (puttyprompt=[A]; puttytitle=[A][$(getip120)]), then open a new set of putty windows, turn on the invert operator for a single search on "[A]", then tag the second set of windows (puttyprompt=[B]; puttytitle=[B][$(getip120)])

### ToDo

* Add Mimimise To Tray once the hotkeys are working
* Add configurable hotkeys to INI file
